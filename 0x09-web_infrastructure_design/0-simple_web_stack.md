## Description

This is a simple web infrastructure that hosts a website that is reachable via `www.foobar.com`. There are no firewalls or SSL certificates for protecting the server's network. Each component (database, application server) has to share the resources (CPU, RAM, and SSD) provided by the server.

## Specifics About This Infrastructure

+ What a server is.<br/>A server is a computer hardware or software that provides services to other computers, which are usually referred to as *clients*.

+ The role of the domain name.<br/>serves to identify internet resources, computers, networks,and services, with a text based level that is easier to memorize than numerical addresses in the internet protocols

+ The type of DNS record `www` is in `www.foobar.com`.<br/>`www.foobar.com` uses an **A record**. This can be checked by running `dig www.foobar.com`.<br/>a www is the subdomain in a DNS record type A<br/>
<i>Address Mapping record (A Record)â€”also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.</i>

+ The role of the web server.<br/>is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users, also serve SMTP simple mail transfer protocol and FTP File Transfer Protocl, email, and file transfer and storage

+ The role of the application server.<br/>the function of the application server is to act as hort (container)  for the user's business logic while facilitating access to and performance

+ The role of the database.<br/>keeps the business every day records, gibs structure to business information. Allow rapid creation, updating and retrieval of business records, with security.

+ What the server uses to communicate with the client What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

## Issues With This Infrastructure

+ The part of the system that if it fails, the whole system fails, are not desirable in cases where high availability and/or reliability is required

+ Systems can be made more robust by adding redundancy across all potential SPOFs

+ Downtime when maintenance needed.<br/>When we need to run some maintenance checks on any component, they have to be put down or the server has to be turned off. Since there's only one server, the website would be experiencing a downtime.

+ Cannot scale if there's too much incoming traffic.<br/>It would be hard to scale this infrastructure becauses one server contains the required components. The server can quickly run out of resources or slow down when it starts receiving a lot of requests.
